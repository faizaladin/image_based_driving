# Neural Network Image Based Driving

## About
This repository trains a model on various maps in the CARLA simulator to return steering controls given an image. The model is able to train on a single weather condition and apply zero shot learning to other weather conditions.

## How To Use
You will need the following pre requirements:
Ubuntu 20.04
CARLA 9.14

1. Install the Conda Environment
<pre>conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate myenv
</pre>

2. We will need to collect data from CARLA for the training process.
<pre>python collect_data.py
</pre>

3. Train the model (An NVIDIA V100 was used to train the model)
<pre>python train.py
</pre>

4. Test the model
<pre>python inference.py
</pre>
